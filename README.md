This repo containg a word in progress on the resource library on Russian Colonialism. Build in Pythoin Django with a MySQL backend, it will eventually allow:
1. Browsing resources
2. Search
3. Suggesitng new resources
4. Suggested resource review and editing by admins
5. Exporting resources
6. Perhaps, an API
